# InfiniteWisdom
A Telegram bot that sends inspirational quotes of infinite wisdom... ðŸ¥ 

## Configuration

InfiniteWisdom can be configured either using environment variables
as well as using a yaml file. You can use both methods at the same time, 
however if an option is present in both locations the environment variable
will always override the value provided in the yaml file. 

### Environment variables

| Name                        | Description                              | Type     | Default                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| BOT_TOKEN                   | The bot token used to authenticate the bot with telegram | String | `-` |
| URL_POOL_SIZE               | Maximum number of URLs to keep in the pool | Integer | `10000` |
| IMAGE_POLLING_TIMEOUT       | Timeout in seconds between image api requests | Integer | `1` |
| GREETINGS_MESSAGE           | Specifies the message a new user is greeted with | String| `Send /inspire for more inspiration :) Or use @InfiniteWisdomBot in a group chat and select one of the suggestions.` |

### yaml file

- ./infinitewisdom.yaml
- ~/.config/infinitewisdom.yaml
- ~/infinitewisdom.yaml

and looks like this:

```

  bot_token: "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
  greetings_message: "Hi there!"
