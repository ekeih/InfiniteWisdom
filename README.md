## Configuration

InfiniteWisdom can be configured either using environment variables
as well as using a yaml file. You can use both methods at the same time, 
however if an option is present in both locations the environment variable
will always override the value provided in the yaml file.

### yaml file

The yaml file can be placed in one of the following directories:

- `./infinitewisdom.yaml`
- `~/.config/infinitewisdom.yaml`
- `~/infinitewisdom.yaml`

and looks like this:

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  telegram:
    admin_usernames:
      - "myadminuser"
      - "myotheradminuser"
    bot_token: "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
    greeting_message: "Hi there!"
    inline_badge_size: 16
    caption_images_with_text: True
  uploader:
    chat_id: "12345678"
    interval: 1
  crawler:
    interval: 1
  persistence:
    url: "sqlite:///infinitewisdom.db"
    file_base_path: "./.image_data"
  image_analysis:
    interval: 1
    tesseract:
      enabled: True
    google_vision:
      enabled: False
      auth_file: "./my-auth-file.json"
      capacity_per_month: 1000
    microsoft_azure:
      enabled: False
      subscription_key: "1234567890684c3baa5a0605712345ab"
      region: "francecentral"
      capacity_per_month: 5000
  stats:
    port: 8000
```

### Crawler

The crawler queries the image api source ([http://inspirobot.me](http://inspirobot.me))
for random images and adds them to the persistence if they don't exist yet.
To not overwhelm the api it is queried in a specific interval so there 
is a slight delay between each request.

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  crawler:
    interval: 1
```

### Persistence

The persistence is used to store image url's, image analysis data
and other meta data related to images.

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  persistence:
    url: "sqlite:///infinitewisdom.db"
    file_base_path: "./.image_data"
```

### Image analysis

`InfiniteWisdom` runs basic image analysis on every image available.
This is done to provide search based on the text in the image.

#### Tesseract

You need to make sure that required `tesseract` packages are installed 
on your system to make it work. Have a look at their [documentation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
After all is set configure `InfiniteWisdom` like this:

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  image_analysis:
    tesseract:
      enabled: True
```

It should be noted though that the quality of `tesseract` is not very good given
the kind of images that are analysed. Current statistics show that only 
in around2/3 of all images a text is detected and even then it sometimes
is just complete garbage. Better than nothing though!

#### Google Vision

Google Vision has a much higher success rate (no statistics about that yet)
but comes with a price (literally). To use the Google Vision API you
have to create an authentication token for `InfiniteWisdom` to use.
Have a look at the official documentation on how to retrieve that and
then specify it's path in the `InfiniteWisdom` configuration:

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  image_analysis:
    google_vision:
      enabled: True
      auth_file: "./googlevision_auth_token.json"
      capacity_per_month: 1000
```

#### Microsoft Computer Vision

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  image_analysis:
    microsoft_azure:
      enabled: False
      subscription_key: "1234567890684c3baa5a0605712345ab"
      region: "francecentral"
      capacity_per_month: 5000
```

#### Combining Analysers

It's also possible to use multiple analysers at the same time. This
allows you to use the costly Google Vision API for only a specific amount
of images a month and use the free tesseract for the rest. To do that 
simply specify all analysers you want to use next to each other so 
it looks like this:

```yaml
InfiniteWisdom:
  [...]
  image_analysis:
    tesseract:
      enabled: True
    google_vision:
      enabled: True
      auth_file: "./googlevision_auth_token.json"
      capacity_per_month: 1000
    [...]
```

## Installation

### FreeBSD

On FreeBSD it is necessary to install the required dependencies manually
since some of them can not be installed using `pip`.

```bash
pkg install python36
pkg install py36-pip
pkg install py27-sqlite3

pip-3.6 install prometheus_client
pip-3.6 install sqlalchemy
pip-3.6 install alembic
pip-3.6 install emoji
pip-3.6 install pyyaml
pip-3.6 install python-telegram-bot==12.0.0b1
pip-3.6 install google-cloud-vision
```

For **PostgreSQL** support add
```bash
pkg install py36-psycopg2
```

## Usage

Create a configuration as described in the section above and start 
the bot using:

```shell
python ./infinitewisdom/bot.py
```
